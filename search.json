    "text": "Purpose/Objective\nIn the Pharmacoepidemiology (PhEpi) unit, effective data management, data analysis, and the generation of outputs, such as plots, tables, and PDF documents, are critical components of project development. In this context, a Version Control System (VCS) plays a pivotal role. A VCS facilitates tracking and managing changes made to the project over time, encompassing any modification to folders, files, and code. This capability empowers teams to work more efficiently and intelligently, ensuring a streamlined and collaborative development process.\nIn addition to these fundamental principles, platforms like GitHub serve as powerful extensions of remote VCS. GitHub is a widely used web-based hosting service that facilitates collaboration among multiple individuals in a specific project, enhancing workflow efficiency within a team.\nConsidering these benefits, this document provides the framework to acquire the basic knowledge and set up an account to participate in the Pharmacoepidemiology GitHub (PhEpiGit).",

However, this document will specifically describe the process using GitHub, as it facilitates compliance with the reproducible research SOP.\nOnce employees become PhEpiGit members, they have write permissions, allowing them to clone, pull, and push to all PhEpiGit repositories.\nPhEpiGit provides a project_template repository that should be used each time a member creates a new repository. This template includes all the folders indicated in PhEpi-1-05_Reproduzierbares Arbeiten.\n\nGo to the upper-right corner of the PhEpiGit and select +, then select New repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Create a new repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Pharmacoepidemiology-UKHD/project_template to create the new repository -A-. This automatically will select the PhEpi as owner. Name the repository -B- and choose a repository visibility -C-. Additionally you can add a description. Lastly, click Create repositry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Create a new repository window\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows a walkthrough of how a new repository takes shape. While GitHub enables repository management tasks, complete control can be achieved using a command line text editor or tools such as RStudio. This SOP emphasizes utilizing RStudio as a central element for effective GitHub repository management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: New repository content based on PhEpi-1-05_Reproduzierbares Arbeiten",
