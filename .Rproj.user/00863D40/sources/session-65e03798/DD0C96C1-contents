This is an extension of the _PhEpi-1-05_Reproduzierbares Arbeiten SOP_ 

## Purpose/Objective


In the Pharmacoepidemiology (PhEpi) unit, effective data management, data analysis, and the generation of outputs, such as plots, tables, and PDF documents, are critical components of project development. In this context, a Version Control System (VCS) plays a pivotal role. A VCS facilitates tracking and managing changes made to the project over time, encompassing any modification to folders, files, and code. This capability empowers teams to work more efficiently and intelligently, ensuring a streamlined and collaborative development process.

In addition to these fundamental principles, platforms like GitHub serve as powerful extensions of remote VCS. GitHub is a widely used web-based hosting service that facilitates collaboration among multiple individuals in a specific project, enhancing workflow efficiency within a team.

Considering these benefits, this document provides the framework to acquire the basic knowledge and set up an account to participate in the Pharmacoepidemiology UKHD GitHub.

## Scope/Application

This standard operating procedure applies to all PhEpi employees working and collaborating on a project hosted on the organisational GitHub.

## 4.	Responsibility

Each repository should be organized systematically by the employee responsible for a project. This employee is also responsible for accepting collaborations on their projects. Only projects related to PhEpi are eligible for hosting on the PhEpiGit.

This is a template for a simple Quarto website that looks like a "book". This is a common format for documentation. It includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The NOAA palette and fonts has been added to `theme.scss`. The webpage will be on the `gh-pages` branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.

The GitHub Action installs R so you can have R code in your qmd or Rmd files. Note, you do not need to make changes to your Rmd files unless your need Quarto features like cross-references.

## GitHub Set-up

-   Click the green "use template" button to make a repository with this content. Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn't work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch). <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2545978/197051535-c43c62de-17e8-40bf-a536-3eea8db250c4.png" alt="image" width="637"/>

-   Turn on GitHub Pages under Settings \> Pages . You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2545978/196808262-3d2262be-b9b5-4897-bba5-fc2f056dd335.png" alt="image" width="540"/>
