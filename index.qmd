This is an extension of the _PhEpi-1-05_Reproduzierbares Arbeiten SOP_ 

## Purpose/Objective

The [Pharmacoepidemiology]{style="color: #2E6B96; font-weight: bold;"} (PhEpi) unit relies on effective data management, thorough data analysis, and creating outputs such as plots, tables, and PDF documents as critical components of project development. In this context, a [Version Control System](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) (VCS) plays a pivotal role. A VCS facilitates tracking and managing changes made to the project over time, encompassing any modification to folders, files, and code. This capability empowers teams to work more efficiently and intelligently, ensuring a streamlined and collaborative development process.

Adding to these core principles, platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com) become potent extensions of remote VCS. _GitHub_, a widely embraced web-based hosting service, fosters seamless collaboration among multiple team members within a project. Its user-friendly interface and robust features enhance workflow efficiency, making teamwork a breeze.

Given these advantages, this document lays out the framework for acquiring basic knowledge and setting up an account to join the _Pharmacoepidemiology GitHub_ (PhEpiGit).


## Scope/Application

This extension of the standard operating procedure (SOP) on Reproducible Research applies to all PhEpi employees working on and collaborating on a project hosted on the organizational GitHub.

## Responsibility

Each repository must be systematically organised by a member responsible for a specific project. This member is also responsible for accepting collaborations on their projects. Only PhEpi-related projects are eligible to be hosted on PhEpiGit.

This is a template for a simple Quarto website that looks like a "book". This is a common format for documentation. It includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The NOAA palette and fonts has been added to `theme.scss`. The webpage will be on the `gh-pages` branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.

The GitHub Action installs R so you can have R code in your qmd or Rmd files. Note, you do not need to make changes to your Rmd files unless your need Quarto features like cross-references.

## GitHub Set-up

-   Click the green "use template" button to make a repository with this content. Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn't work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch). <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2545978/197051535-c43c62de-17e8-40bf-a536-3eea8db250c4.png" alt="image" width="637"/>

-   Turn on GitHub Pages under Settings \> Pages . You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2545978/196808262-3d2262be-b9b5-4897-bba5-fc2f056dd335.png" alt="image" width="540"/>

-   Edit the repo description and Readme to add a link to the webpage. When you edit the description, you will see the link url in the url box or you can click on the Actions tab or the Settings \> Pages page to find the url.
