title: "Cloning an existing repository from GitHub"
---

Cloning an existing repository is a vital process for collaboration among PhEpiGit members. To collaborate, individuals need to visit the specific PhEpiGit repository and follow the instructions provided from Section 5.2, Step 3, to Section 5.3. External collaborators from PhEpi can also be invited using the **Collaborators and Teams** option on the GitHub repository settings.
Collaborator must create their own branch before commencing work. A new branch can be created by on Git tab (@fig-changebranch Panel A. a) and clicking the **New Branch** (@fig-changebranch Panel A. b). A window appears where the employee's UKHD name abbreviation (KÃ¼rzel) (e.g., New employee: NEmp) must be assigned to the branch name. Ensure **Sync branch with remote** is checked to create the branch effectively. This action automatically switches the branch from main/origin to NEmp (@fig-changebranch).
