title: "Porject template"
---

PhEpiGit provides a [**project_template**](https://github.com/Pharmacoepidemiology-UKHD/project_template) repository that should be used each time a member creates a new repository. This template includes all the folders specified in _PhEpi-1-05_Reproduzierbares Arbeiten._


_**Important Information:**_

- **.gitignore** file: This specifies which files and folders will be ignored in the pushing process to the remote repository (GitHub). We have already included there the `data` folder which may contain sensitive information (e.g. patient data). Please make sure to save all data in that folder, otherwise include the name of the data file in the `.gitignore` file. More information can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
