title: "Committing and Pushing to/from new Branch"
---

Once you've created your **branch**, you can commit and push your work to your GitHub branch, following the instructions outlined in [Committing and Pushing - origin/main Branch](commit_push_main.qmd). Just ensure that you're executing these actions from your branch.

If you want your work to be merged into the main/origin branch, you need to open a pull request on PhEpiGit. This action requests the merge and serves as a communication tool, especially with the repository owner, allowing for discussion and review of your changes before they are integrated.

After pushing your work, go to PhEpiGit and locate the repository you are collaborating with. Click **main** to switch to the member branch (@fig-switching). From there, you can initiate the pull request process to merge your changes into the main/origin branch.

Once on the selected branch **NEmp**, as shown in @fig-pullrequest, click [[-]{style="color: #143D59"}A[-]{style="color: #143D59"}]{style="color: white; font-weight: bold; background-color: #143D59; border-radius: 50%;"} **Contribute**, then **Open pull request** [[-]{style="color: #143D59"}B[-]{style="color: #143D59"}]{style="color: white; font-weight: bold; background-color: #143D59; border-radius: 50%;"}. A window pops up where a title and description for the request can be provided. After submitting the request, the repository owner can check and accept the collaboratorâ€™s work.
