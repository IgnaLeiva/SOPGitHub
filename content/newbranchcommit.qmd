title: "Committing and Pushing to/from new Branch"
---



Follow the instructions in section 5.4 to commit and push a piece of work to/from a new (side) branch of an existing repository/project. The additional step is to open a pull request on PhEpiGit. A pull request enables to communicate to others, especially the repository owner, which files/code/data are ready to be merged from a side branch to the main/origin branch.
A pull request can be opened after pushing a piece of work to a side branch. Once the work has been pushed, go to PhEpiGit and locate the repository being collaborated on. Click main to switch to the member branch (@fig-switching).

Once on the selected branch, as shown in @fig-pullrequest, click (A) the Contribute button to (B) Open a pull request. A window pops up where a title and description for the request can be provided. After submitting the request, the repository owner can check and accept the collaboratorâ€™s work.
